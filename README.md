# .NET Garbage Collector Internals

This repo contains the slides and code for my talk about the internals of .NET / .NET Core Memory Management and Garbage Collection.

### How to build the code

You need to have the [.NET Core 3 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed (at the time of this writing, it's available only in preview 4).
You can build the solution by calling dotnet build on the sln file. Please note that the WPF project can only run on Windows.
